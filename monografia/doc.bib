Five years on, this paper captures in one place the various applications, improvements suggested and related subsequent publications, and describes initial experience from experiments using hashcash. The hashcash CPU cost-function computes a token which can be used as a proof-of-work. Interactive and non- interactive variants of cost-functions can be constructed which can be used in situations where the server can issue a challenge (connection oriented interactive protocol), and where it can not (where the communication is store–and– forward, or packet oriented) respectively.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

@article{Szabo1996,
abstract = {The contract, a set of promises agreed to in a "meeting of the minds", is the traditional way to formalize a relationship. While contracts are primarily used in business relationships (the focus of this article), they can also involve personal relationships such as marraiges. Contracts are also important in politics, not only because of "social contract" theories but also because contract enforcement has traditionally been considered a basic function of capitalist governments. Computers make possible the running of algorithms heretofore prohibitively costly, and networks the quicker transmission of larger and more sophsiticated messages. Furthermore, computer scientists and cryptographers have recently discovered many new and quite interesting algorithms. Combining these messages and algorithms makes possible a wide variety of new protocols. New institutions, and new ways to formalize the relationships that make up these institutions, are now made possible by the digital revolution. I call these new contracts "smart", because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.},

@article{DeCaro2011,
abstract = {It has been recently discovered that some cyclic groups that could be used in Cryptography admit a special bilinear pairing map that introduces extra structure to the group. Bilinear pairing maps were first used to break cryptosystems (see, for example, [1], [2], [3]) and later it was realized that the extra structure could be exploited to build cryptosystems with extra properties. Boneh and Franklins identity-based encryption scheme [4] is the most famous early example of what could be achieved using bilinear maps. After that, a plethora of cryptosystems have been designed using bilinear maps. No full and freely available implementation of pairing based cryptography was available until this work. Recent proposals [13], [14], [15] fall short of this goal as either their source code is not available or because they support a limited range of elliptic curve. Moreover, neither one of [13], [14], [15] implements preprocessing that is crucial to reduce the computation time. In this work, we present jPBC a Java port of the PBC library written in C [24], [25]. jPBC provides a full ecosystem of interfaces and classes to simplify the use of the bilinear maps even for a non-cryptographer. jPBC supports different types of elliptic curves, preprocessing which can speedup the computation significantly and it is ready for the mobile world. Moreover a benchmark comparison between jPBC and PBC has been performed to measure the gap between the two libraries. Furthermore jPBC has been benchmarked on different Android mobile platforms. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

@article{Lewko2011,
abstract = {We propose a Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) system. In our system, any party can become an authority and there is no requirement for any global coordination other than the creation of an initial set of common reference parameters. A party can simply act as an ABE authority by creating a public key and issuing private keys to different users that reflect their attributes. A user can encrypt data in terms of any boolean formula over attributes issued from any chosen set of authorities. Finally, our system does not require any central authority. In constructing our system, our largest technical hurdle is to make it collusion resistant. Prior Attribute-Based Encryption systems achieved collusion resistance when the ABE sys- tem authority “tied” together different components (representing different attributes) of a user's private key by randomizing the key. However, in our system each component will come from a potentially different authority, where we assume no coordination between such authorities. We create new techniques to tie key components together and prevent collusion attacks between users with different global identifiers. We prove our system secure using the recent dual system encryption methodology where the security proof works by first converting the challenge ciphertext and private keys to a semi-functional form and then arguing security. We follow a recent variant of the dual system proof technique due to Lewko andWaters and build our system using bilinear groups of composite order. We prove security under similar static assumptions to the LW paper in the random oracle model},

@book{Mark2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Permissioned blockchains are arising as a solution to federate companies prompting accountable interactions. A variety of consensus algorithms for such blockchains have been proposed, each of which has different benefits and drawbacks. Proof-of-Authority (PoA) is a new family of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms largely used in practice to ensure better performance than traditional Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). However, the lack of adequate analysis of PoA hinders any cautious evaluation of their effectiveness in real-world permissioned blockchains deployed over the Internet, hence on an eventually synchronous network experimenting Byzantine nodes. In this paper, we analyse two of the main PoA algorithms, named Aura and Clique, both in terms of provided guarantees and performances. First, we derive their functioning including how messages are exchanged, then we weight, by relying on the CAP theorem, consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. We also report a qualitative latency analysis based on message rounds. The analysis advocates that PoA for permissioned blockchains, deployed over the Internet with Byzantine nodes, do not provide adequate consistency guarantees for scenarios where data integrity is essential. We claim that PBFT can fit better such scenarios, despite a limited loss in terms of performance.},

During recent decades, a plethora of initiatives - driven by international organizations - has emerged to define the required models describing the exchange of information between EHRs. These models cover different essential characteristics for building interoperable EHRs, such as architecture, methodology, communication, safety or terminology, among others. In this context, the European reference frame for the standardized exchange of EHR is the recently approved ISO/EN 13606 standard. This multi-part standard provides the syntactic and semantic capabilities (through a dual model approach) as well as terminology, security and interface considerations for the standardized exchange of EHR. This paper provides (a) an introduction to the different standardization efforts related to the interoperable exchange of EHR around the world, and (b) a description of how the ISO/EN 13606 standard provides interoperable sharing of clinical information.},
